                <p><b>The Government Botanical Garden</b> is a botanical garden in Udhagamandalam, near Coimbatore (Ooty), Tamil Nadu state, India laid out in 1848.
                     The gardens, divided into several sections, cover an area of around 22 hectares (54 acres), and lie on the lower slopes of Doddabetta peak.
                      The garden has a terraced layout.
                     It is maintained by the Tamil Nadu Horticulture Department.
                    The present botanical gardens are divided into six sections:
                    Lower Garden, New Garden, Italian Garden, Conservatory, Fountain Terrace and Nurseries.</p>
                <p><h4>Lower Garden</h4>
                    Botanical map of Indian states
                    The lower garden comprises the entrance and the lower lawns.
                     The entrance of the garden leads into an extensive lush green lawn of Kikiyu grass (Pennisetum Clandestinum) which is known for its springy vigour.
                      A fern house with 127 species of ferns is situated on the left along the road leading to Raj Bhavan amidst another expanse of lawns and historic gatehouses. 
                      The prime attractions in this section are the carpet-bet design of the map of the Indian Union laid out with selective plants and the fossil trunk of 20 million years old, erected on a pedestal.
                      <h4>New Garden</h4>
                      The new garden developed recently, comprises the area between the front garden and the crescent-shaped pond at the bandstand.
                       
                      This section consists of:
                       A rose garden with three hundred varieties of hybrid tea roses, Floribunda and Polyanthas rose varieties.
                       Large number of flowerbeds designed to match the slopes and contour of this area.
                       Carpet-bed emblems of the Government of Tamil Nadu and the Government of India.
                       Natural ponds with aquatic plants.
                      <h4>Italian Garden</h4>
                      This garden was first laid out by Italian prisoners of World War I, who were shifted to Ooty.
                      They were placed under the control of the Military station in Ootacamund.
                      Asters, ageratum, balsam, begonia, petunia, pansy, phlox, cosmos, zinnia and perennial flowers like salvia, delphinium, larkspur, and dahlia are the main attraction in this garden
                      <h4>The Conservatory</h4>
                      The public conservatory was constructed in 1912 with the objective of grouping various flowering plants. 
                      Colourful annuals and perennials like Cineraria, Schizanthus, Calceolaria, Balsam, Cyclamen, Gloxinia, Tuberous begonia, Coleus, Geranium, Chrysanthemum, Primulas, Tydea, Achemenes, etc., find a place in this conservatory
                      <h4>The Nurseries</h4>
                      The nurseries which are about 100 metres above the lower lawns, consist of eight glass-houses and a series of terraces for introduction and breeding of exotic plants. 
                      The glass-houses are utilized for growing Begonias, Ferns, Cacti, Succulents, Orchids and Bulbous plants for providing a continuous supply of potted plants to be grouped periodically in the conservatories. 
                      The terraces are utilised for growing plants for cut flowers, seed and also for trial purposes.
                      <h4>The Flower Show</h4>
                      The first flower show was first organised in the year 1896 by the chairman of the Nilgiris Agri-Horticultural Society, Mr.J.H.Tremenhere, the then Collector of Nilgiris. 
                      The government took over the flower show from the Nilgiris Agri-Horticultural Society in 1980 by forming a committee called the Nilgiris Flower and Fruit Show Committee. 
                      The flower show attracts about 150,000 tourists each year from all over the world.

                Ooty Lake is an artificial lake constructed by John Sullivan in 1824. 
                The water flowing down mountain streams in the Ooty valley was dammed to form the lake. 
                The lake became empty on three occasions when it breached its bund. 
                Originally, the lake was intended to be used for fishing, with ferries being used to travel across the lake. 
                It gradually shrunk from its original size, giving place to the current bus stand, race course and the lake park. 
                The Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation, on behalf of the Tourism Department, took possession of the lake in 1973 to provide boating facilities as a tourist attraction.
                <h3>Boat House</h3>
                The boat house, which adjoins the lake, was opened by the Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation (TTDC).
                Boating is the prime attraction at the lake. The boat house offers boating facilities with paddle boats, row boats, and motorboats. 
                It also features a garden, a mini-train, and an amusement park.
                Other notable features include a canteen run by the TTDC and pony rides in front of the boat house.

                Fun activities inside Ooty Lake include a mini-train (especially for kids), a 7D cinema, horror and mirror house, dashing car, break-dance, and Columbus ride.

                Other things to do nearby Ooty Lake include horse rides and cycling.

                The Nilgiri Mountain Railway (NMR) is a 1,000 mm (3 ft 3+3⁄8 in) metre gauge railway in Nilgiris district, Tamil Nadu, India, built by the British in 1908. 
                The railway is operated by the Southern Railway and is the only rack railway in India.
                The railway relies on its fleet of steam locomotives.
                NMR switched to diesel locomotives on the section between Mettupalyam and Udhagamandalam. 
                Local people and visitors led a campaign to return to steam locomotives in this section.
                In July 2005, UNESCO added the Nilgiri Mountain Railway as an extension to the World Heritage Site of Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. 
                The site then became known as Mountain Railways of India<br>
                The uphill journey takes around 290 minutes (4.8 hours), and the downhill journey takes 215 minutes (3.6 hours). 
                It has the steepest track in Asia with a maximum gradient of 8.33%. 
                During Meter Gauge era in 1990s, The Nilgiri Express used to run between Chennai(then Madras) & Udhagamandalam(then Ooty) directly. 
                Timings were:- Madras 21.00; Ooty 10.20 & in return:- Ooty 16.30; Madras 05.50.But it was stopped after NMR got UNESCO World Heritage Tag in 1994. 
                As of 2007, a daily train crosses the rack section, which starts from Mettupalayam at 07:10 and reaches Udhagamandalam at noon. 
                The return train starts from Udhagamandalam at 14:00, and reaches at 17:35. 
                The train is scheduled to connect to the Nilgiri Express, which travels from Mettupalayam to Chennai via Coimbatore. 
                A summer special service runs in April and May, starting from Mettupalayam at 09:30 am and from Udhagamandalam at 12:15 pm. 
                Between Coonoor and Udagamandalam, four daily trains run each way

                <p>Arriving at Ooty's famed shooting spot, I was greeted by an enchanting scene of rolling hills and serene lakes. 
                    Against this picturesque backdrop, I embarked on a horse riding adventure, trotting along winding trails and verdant meadows.
                    With each stride, I felt a sense of freedom and connection to nature, surrounded by the tranquility of Ooty's splendor. 
                    The cool mountain breeze brushed against my skin as I took in the breathtaking vistas, each turn revealing a new facet of the hill station's beauty.</p>

                About 15 km from Ooty town is Shooting Point, a picturesque patch of meadows amidst the rolling green hills of the Nilgiris. 
                This vast expanse of mist-clad undulating green meadows, formerly known as Wenlock Downs, was once a popular hunting ground for the British and is now home to the Gymkhana Golf Club, the Hindustan Photo Films Company and a state-run sheep farm. 
                This strikingly spectacular meadowland covering a cluster of incessant slopes and opulent woodlands has featured in numerous movies and has thus been nicknamed by locals as Shooting Point or Shooting Medu. 
                These meadows and rolling moors, spotted with lush shola forests, a unique feature of the Western Ghats, are a hotspot of biodiversity and a place of pristine natural beauty. 
                The unending wavy grasslands and lush misty hillocks of this heavenly tract of the Nilgiris are a paradise for photographers and attract hordes of film crews all year round.<br>
                The Shooting Spot offers a panoramic view of the Nilgiris as well as the vast expanse of undulating meadows covered with shola and pine forests. 
                The serene ambience of Shooting Spot, enriched with the scent of pine forests and eucalyptus, makes it a perfect spot for enjoying a picnic or a day out with friends and family. 
                It is a perfect destination for tourists in search of a break from the fatiguing noises of urban life. 
                The enthralling view of white fog from the nearby Mukurthi Peak gradually rolling in over the meadows grazed by white sheep is something that will sooth any numb mind. 
                Head to the Shooting Point and have a stroll through the misty grassland and soak in the tranquillity of Nature.

                <p>My visit to Madras Regimental Centre (MRC) Wellington, where my father serves proudly in the esteemed Madras Regiment, was a blend of reverence and pride. 
                    Amidst the disciplined routines and camaraderie, the sight of the historic Black Bridge spanning the water added a touch of nostalgia. 
                    It served as a silent witness to the rich legacy and unwavering dedication embodied by the soldiers training within MRC Wellington's hallowed grounds.
